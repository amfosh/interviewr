# Usage

You're an interview newbie and this is one of your first times interviewing someone for a open seat on your team. You're not really sure what to ask. Using Interviewr, you will be able to shuffle through high-level questions you can ask anyone, for any role! Don't like the question? Skip to the next one. Think something is missing? Add a new question once you log in using a unique username. Or, edit a question that you think could be worded in a better way. Interviewr is a crowdsourced database of great interview questions, so we're open to anyone adding or editing the crowd's questions.
